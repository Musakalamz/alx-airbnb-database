# ALX Airbnb Database Project

This repository contains the database design, schema, and sample data for an Airbnb-like application as part of the ALX Airbnb Database Module.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on database design, normalization, schema creation, and seeding for an Airbnb-like application. The goal is to create a robust relational database that ensures scalability, efficiency, and real-world functionality.

## Repository Structure

- **ERD/**: Contains the Entity-Relationship Diagram and requirements documentation
  - `requirements.md`: Detailed description of entities and relationships

- **normalization.md**: Documentation of the normalization process to achieve 3NF

- **database-script-0x01/**: Contains the database schema definition
  - `schema.sql`: SQL script to create the database tables, constraints, and indexes
  - `README.md`: Documentation for the schema design

- **database-script-0x02/**: Contains the database seed data
  - `seed.sql`: SQL script to populate the database with sample data
  - `README.md`: Documentation for the seed data

## Tasks Completed

1. **Define Entities and Relationships in ER Diagram**
   - Identified all entities and their attributes
   - Defined relationships between entities
   - Created comprehensive documentation in `ERD/requirements.md`

2. **Normalize Database Design**
   - Applied normalization principles to achieve 3NF
   - Documented the normalization process in `normalization.md`

3. **Design Database Schema (DDL)**
   - Created SQL CREATE TABLE statements for each entity
   - Implemented proper data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints
   - Created necessary indexes for optimal performance
   - Documented the schema design in `database-script-0x01/README.md`

4. **Seed the Database with Sample Data**
   - Created SQL INSERT statements for all tables
   - Ensured sample data reflects real-world usage
   - Maintained proper relationships between entities
   - Documented the seed data in `database-script-0x02/README.md`
